# kotlin-ktor-bff
Backend For Frontend (BFF) written in Kotlin using Ktor.

This project is inspired by the job description for the Senior Software Engineer role at Auto Trader UK. I saw they have mentioned the Kotlin BFF framework.

I have not written any backends after I have graduated from the university. This is going to be a playground for me to explore how I can utilise my Kotlin knowledge to develop a backend that works. Please expect things can be broken or poorly written. 

I do _still_ have a full-time job, and my private life to busy with. My plan is to first make this BFF work, and refactor later on to make it better.

Preliminary this BFF will be served the Giphy APIs to accompany my another demo app. 

Since obviously this is an open-source project, Collaborations or comments are all welcomed.

I must have to be honest that I work much better when I have a good project partner. Currently as this is still a solo project, apologise for my procrastination.
